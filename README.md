------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm an enthusiastic, determined and adaptable full stack web developer and former Software Performance Testing Consultant, with a Computing Science degree.

I have 13 years software testing experience in various sectors; including Finance, Insurance, Banking, Utilities and Pensions.

Making the transition from tester to developer, I recently completed the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/) 16-week software bootcamp and look forward to a career developing high quality software solutions.

## Skills

#### Analytical

Throughout my software testing consultant career, as well as at Makers, I’ve been required to break down ‘challenges’ and create satisfactory ‘solutions’.

Whilst performance testing Aviva’s web service gateway, I was given a complex load profile from the architects. Utilising a selection of existing test scripts, tailoring some new ones, and using ‘if’ and ‘while’ statement logic, I was able to successfully simulate the required load.

Whilst at Makers, I used various modelling techniques, (CRC and Domain Modelling) to break down system requirements, which then enabled me to derive with the necessary objects (classes, methods, databases/relevant db tables) to build the required application.  

#### Communication & Collaboration

Working as a testing consultant necessitated strong verbal and written communications skills, as well as an ability to collaborate with various individuals from multiple teams; for instance when creating test strategies I was required to liaise with project managers, developers, BAs, DBAs, architects and environment managers.

Having these skills really helped whilst working solo, as well as in teams on the Makers course, and will serve me well going forward as full stack web developer.

#### Determination & Dedication

I’ve been told, by previous managers and peers, that I’m one of the most determined people they have ever met.

My determination has taken me from being a double glazing installer, to completing a computing science degree and working for several blue chip companies as a software testing consultant, and on to becoming a full stack web developer; if you don’t give in, you’ll always win!
