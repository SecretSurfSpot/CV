## Skills

#### Technical: LoadRunner, C, SQL, VBA

During several projects I've used LoadRunner, a Performance Testing tools, to record test scripts. Using C, I've customised the scripts to ensure they're completely fit for purpose. I've written SQL queries to extract various forms of data from databases. I've written macros in VBA to process various types of raw data (such as Server CPU usage stats) and present the data in graphical format.   

#### Strategising

For over 10 years I've created test strategies for various clients and projects. Liaising with a multitude of SME (subject matter experts) including Architects, BAs, DBAs and Environment teams has enable me to build a complete picture of the overall system, it's requirements and to devise and document a successful testing strategy.

#### Delivery

Throughout my testing career I've always strived to deliver the required outcomes on time. Whilst working for several clients, including Aviva and IFDS timelines we often very tight; prioritising deliverables and identifying the best approach to complete each one helped lead to successful outcomes.
